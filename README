## Description

CLI Package Manager is a command-line tool (CLI) for managing dependencies in Node.js projects efficiently. It allows developers to install, uninstall, and update npm packages without leaving the terminal.

## Installation

To install CLI Package Manager globally and use it across different projects, follow these steps:

1. Install CLI Package Manager globally using npm:

This will install CLI Package Manager globally on your system, making it available for use in any project.

## Usage

Once CLI Package Manager is installed globally, you can run it from the terminal using the following command:

```bash
cli-package-manager
```

This will start the command-line interface where you can select the actions you want to perform, such as installing, uninstalling, or updating npm packages.

### Running with `.bat` File

You can also execute the program using the `run-cli.bat` file. Simply double-click the `run-cli.bat` file in your file explorer or run it from the command line with:

```bash
.\run-cli.bat
```

## Available Commands

- `install`: Install one or multiple npm packages.
- `uninstall`: Uninstall one or multiple npm packages.
- `exit`: Exit the application.

## Testing
